KNOWN BUGS
==========

Still outstanding:

    - KS TOPS-10 7.03 install from tape periodically hangs on MT.
    - KS TOPS-10 7.03 disk boot produces:
	KLH10 PANIC: rh11_iobeg: drv/ctrlr mismatch: 7/0

(Of course, this will never be a complete list!)


KLH10 CHANGES
=============

KLH10 2.0A: 19-Nov-2001
    - Revised ARP code in dpimp.c to fix problems with Linux port;
	ITS networking now supported on Linux!
    - Cleaned up Solaris port.  Two Makefiles now provided, one for
	GCC and the other for SUN C.  Compiles and runs, but actual network
	operation not yet verified.  
    - Fixed bug with writing TPS format tape images (caught by John Wilson).
    - Added "port-ks" target to Makefile to help porters.
