I do a lot of work on my Mac, some on Linux+BSD+other Unices, and most of all on TOPS-20. (Some Tops-10, WAITS, and ITS as well.)

I'd like a Mac native build of KLH10, for completeness' sake. It appears that I'm the only heavy Mac user here, so it's up to me to provide it.
It will take a while, but we'll get there.
